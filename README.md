[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-learn-typescript)

error:

                This is not the tsc command you are looking for


To get access to the TypeScript compiler, tsc, from the command line either:

- Use npm install typescript to first add TypeScript to your project before using npx
- Use yarn to avoid accidentally running code from un-installed packages


```

ts-node ./src/type-challenges/easy/pick.ts

```
